# WiFiProbe
Openwrt WiFi Probe, with http post to send data to server.
You need to have a OpenwrtSDK to compile the source code. When it is done, you will get a IPK like "Scannerxxxxx.ipk".
Switch your wireless network adapter to "monitor" mode, install this IPK, and tape Scanner in the shell. Then the node is sending data to your server.

The data it sends is a json. Have fun.
